TOGETHER

When I see the world, for you
When you became the world to me
A rainbow arched beyond the storms
To green pastures of destiny
Where our paths converge
As if God Himself determined
That this was the time
That we had walked enough alone
On those sad and winding roads
When I see the world, for you
By you, this is now a beautiful place
In the sun that parts the darkened clouds
In the presence of His grace
Your hand in my hand, together
We face the uncharted horizon
Of hope, of promise, of love
That God's gift of time is ours to share
As we walk by the calm and shimmering sea
Down the glorious road now set before us
Onward to eternity
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>RECRUITS

tortured souls walk through this place
i look at face after face
and in each one i see a piece of me
their futures we try to foresee
and failiures we try to prevent
their time in hell not yet spent
so we hand them a rifle and uniform
they're sparkling boots not yet worn
as they stand proud on parade
not yet been on their first crusade
their families so proud
they pledge allegiance to the crown
the war torn soldiers pass them by
a tear wells up in their eye
they see themselves standing there
the tender youth so unaware
of the torment and troubles they will face
outside the walls of the army base
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>DO NOT GO GENTLE

Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
